grbm and sbpl:  good fit, errors and stats.

copl:  doesn't fit high energy data.

grbm+lpow:  PL not needed.  It becomes very steep and only contributed to the LAT data.  The high-energy data doesn't appear to be very good so it'll be hard to constrain any 2 or 3 component models. Errros not very good.

sbpl+lpow:  had same problem as grbm+lpow.

copl+lpow:  good fit, good errors, good stats.  best so far.

grbm+blackb:  BB wasn't very significant.  I tried to get it to stick around 40-50 keV and the tem at around 1000 keV to get the BB to be significant, but it wouldn't stick.  Maybe BXA?  kT could be around 6 or 24.  Neither allow for error calculations and both appear to be just as good of fit.  Went with kT = 24 and no errors.  BXA will figure this out.

sbpl+blackb:  kT = 22.5, was able to get good fit, good errors, good stats.

copl+blackb:  kT = 23, wasn't able to get any errors.  Not good at higher energies.

grbm+blackb+lpow:  some interesting configurations worked at first, but then it falls into PL = -1.25276, kT = 25 , with a fairly insignificant BB.  No errors possible.  Kept asking me to fit.


sbpl+blackb+lpow:  had trouble with errors on the PL and it's amplitude.

copl+blackb+lpow:  had some trouble with errors.
